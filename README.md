#  Minotaur’s Birthday Party

The Minotaur invited N guests to his birthday party. When the guests arrived, he made the following announcement.

The guests may enter his labyrinth, one at a time and only when he invites them to do so. At the end of the labyrinth, the Minotaur placed a birthday cupcake on a plate. When a guest finds a way out of the labyrinth, he or she may decide to eat the birthday cupcake or leave it. If the cupcake is eaten by the previous guest, the next guest will find the cupcake plate empty and may request another cupcake by asking the Minotaur’s servants. When the servants bring a new cupcake the guest may decide to eat it or leave it on the plate.

The Minotaur’s only request for each guest is to not talk to the other guests about her or his visit to the labyrinth after the game has started. The guests are allowed to come up with a strategy prior to the beginning of the game. There are many birthday cupcakes, so the Minotaur may pick the same guests multiple times and ask them to enter the labyrinth. Before the party is over, the Minotaur wants to know if all of his guests have had the chance to enter his labyrinth. To do so, the guests must announce that they have all visited the labyrinth at least once.

Now the guests must come up with a strategy to let the Minotaur know that every guest entered the Minotaur’s labyrinth. It is known that there is already a birthday cupcake left at the labyrinth’s exit at the start of the game. 

Note: Program to simulate the protocol where each guest is represented by one running thread.

# Minotaur’s Crystal Vase

The Minotaur decided to show his favorite crystal vase to his guests in a dedicated showroom with a single door. He did not want many guests to gather around the vase and accidentally break it. For this reason, he would allow only one guest at a time into the showroom. 

Protocol would allow the quests to line in a queue. Every guest exiting the room was responsible to notify the guest standing in front of the queue that the showroom is available. Guests were allowed to queue multiple times.

Note: Implemention of strategy/protocol where each guest is represented by 1 running thread. 

# The Birthday Presents Party

The Minotaur’s birthday party was a success. The Minotaur received a lot of presents from his guests. The next day he decided to sort all of his presents and start writing “Thank you” cards. Every present had a tag with a unique number that was associated with the guest who gave it. Initially all of the presents were thrown into a large bag with no particular order. The Minotaur wanted to take the presents from this unordered bag and create a chain of presents hooked to each other with special links (similar to storing elements in a linked-list). In this chain (linked-list) all of the presents had to be ordered according to their tag numbers in increasing order. The Minotaur asked 4 of his servants to help him with creating the chain of presents and writing the cards to his guests. Each servant would do one of three actions in no particular order:

- Take a present from the unordered bag and add it to the chain in the correct location by hooking it to the predecessor’s link. The servant also had to make sure that the newly added present is also linked with the next present in the chain.
- Write a “Thank you” card to a guest and remove the present from the chain. To do so, a servant had to unlink the gift from its predecessor and make sure to connect the predecessor’s link with the next gift in the chain.
- Per the Minotaur’s request, check whether a gift with a particular tag was present in the chain or not; without adding or removing a new gift, a servant would scan through the chain and check whether a gift with a particular tag is already added to the ordered chain of gifts or not.

As the Minotaur was impatient to get this task done quickly, he instructed his servants not to wait until all of the presents from the unordered bag are placed in the chain of linked and ordered presents. Instead, every servant was asked to alternate adding gifts to the ordered chain and writing “Thank you” cards. The servants were asked not to stop or even take a break until the task of writing cards to all of the Minotaur’s guests was complete.

Note: Design and implemention of a concurrent linked-list that can help the Minotaur’s 4 servants with this task. In testing phase, simulate this concurrent “Thank you” card writing scenario by dedicating 1 thread per servant and assuming that the Minotaur received 500,000 presents from his guests.
